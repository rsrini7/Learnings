# The VIO-40K Breakthrough: Scaling Quantum Computing to 10,000 Qubits

## Executive Summary
On December 9, 2025, QuantWare announced the VIO-40K™, the world's first quantum processor unit (QPU) architecture capable of delivering 10,000 qubits—a 100x leap over current industry standards of around 100 qubits. This innovation solves longstanding scaling barriers using 3D chiplet design and high-fidelity connections, enabling practical applications in drug discovery, materials science, and optimization problems. Integrated with NVIDIA's NVQLink and CUDA-Q platforms, VIO-40K merges quantum and AI computing for hybrid systems. First shipments are slated for 2028, with production ramping up via a new fabrication facility in 2026. This marks quantum computing's shift from theory to economic reality.

## Introduction
Quantum computing promises to tackle problems intractable for classical computers, from simulating molecules for new drugs to optimizing global supply chains. However, progress has been slow: Google's qubit count grew from 53 in 2019 to just 105 in 2025, while IBM plans a 120-qubit system for 2028. QuantWare, a Delft-based leader in superconducting quantum hardware, has shattered this stagnation with VIO-40K. This whitepaper outlines the technology, its implications, and the path forward, drawing directly from the announcement and verified sources.

## The Scaling Challenge in Quantum Computing
Quantum processors rely on qubits, which are fragile and prone to errors. Key hurdles include:
- **Wiring Complexity**: Connecting thousands of qubits requires massive input-output (I/O) lines without signal loss.
- **Footprint and Efficiency**: Larger systems demand more space, power, and cost, limiting scalability.
- **Industry Stagnation**: Most systems hover at 100 qubits, far below the millions needed for real-world impact.

VIO-40K addresses these by rethinking architecture at the hardware level, making hyper-scaled QPUs feasible and affordable.

## VIO-40K Architecture: A 3D Scaling Revolution
VIO-40K builds on QuantWare's VIO™ platform, using modular chiplets stacked in 3D for seamless integration—like linking small computers into a supercomputer with perfect communication.

### Core Innovations
- **3D Chiplet Design**: Stacks qubit modules vertically, reducing wiring bottlenecks and enabling 10,000 qubits in a compact form factor smaller than today's 100-qubit systems.
- **Ultra-High-Fidelity Connections**: Ensures low-error links between chips, critical for maintaining quantum coherence.
- **Open Compatibility**: Works with any superconducting qubit type, democratizing access like open-source AI models.

This design shifts quantum from lab experiments to industrial production.

## Key Technical Specifications
| Feature                  | Details                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|

| I/O Lines               | 40,000                              |
| Scaling Method          | 3D vertical integration with chiplets |
| Efficiency Gains        | Orders-of-magnitude better compute per dollar and watt |
| Error Rate              | Ultra-low via high-fidelity inter-chip links |

These specs deliver 100x more qubits than competitors, verified in QuantWare's press release.

## Integration with NVIDIA: Quantum-AI Hybrid Power
VIO-40K isn't standalone—it's built for collaboration. QuantWare integrates with NVIDIA's ecosystem:
- **NVQLink**: An open interconnect for low-latency connections between quantum processors and GPU supercomputers, announced October 2025.
- **CUDA-Q Platform**: Enables developers to program hybrid quantum-classical apps, accelerating error correction and simulations.

This fusion powers AI agents with quantum speed, solving problems like portfolio optimization across millions of variables or molecular modeling in days, not decades.

## Transformative Applications
VIO-40K unlocks quantum's potential across sectors:
- **Drug Discovery**: Simulate quantum-level interactions to design targeted therapies.
- **Materials Science**: Model new superconductors or batteries for clean energy.
- **Climate Modeling**: Run hyper-accurate simulations on hybrid systems.
- **Finance and Logistics**: Optimize complex networks in real-time.
- **AI Enhancement**: Boost training with quantum algorithms for superintelligent models by 2027.

As QuantWare CEO Matt Rijlaarsdam noted, this "paves the way for economically relevant quantum computers."

## Timeline and Roadmap
- **2025**: Reservations open; announcement solidifies VIO as a scaling standard.
- **2026**: Kilofab opens in Delft, boosting production 20x for Quantum Open Architecture devices.
- **2028**: First VIO-40K shipments to customers.
- **Beyond**: Roadmap targets 1 million qubits by 2029 via arrayed units.

This aligns with converging tech waves: AI superintelligence (2027), robotics commercialization (2026), and quantum mainstreaming (2028).

## Conclusion
VIO-40K represents a pivotal moment, verified through QuantWare's announcement and industry coverage. By solving scaling, it accelerates quantum's integration with AI and robotics, urging early adopters to act now. The future isn't distant—it's shipping in 2028.
