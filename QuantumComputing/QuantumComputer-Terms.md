# Quantum Computing Key Terms

## Core Concepts

*   **Classical Bit**: Like a coin lying flat—only "heads" (0) or "tails" (1).
*   **Qubit**: Like a spinning/magic coin that can be both heads and tails (superposition) simultaneously; e.g., 70% likely heads/30% likely tails until measured. Normal computer bits only show one state at a time.
*   **Superposition**: The ability of a qubit to exist in multiple states at once (like hiding in two places during hide and seek); enables quantum parallelism.
*   **Quantum Parallelism**: A quantum computer can explore multiple possibilities in one operation (vs. classical computers checking one password at a time).
*   **Entanglement**: When two qubits are linked such that measuring one instantly reveals the other’s state—no matter the distance (like magic matching cards or coins with a shared secret).
*   **Measurement**: Peeking at a qubit to see its state; collapses superposition to a single state (heads or tails).
*   **Quantum Indeterminacy**: A qubit’s state is unknown until measured—its superposition makes the result a surprise.
*   **Decoherence**: When a qubit loses its superposition/entanglement (e.g., from external interference like a bumped toy) and behaves like a classical bit.
*   **No-Cloning Theorem**: A perfect copy of a qubit cannot be made (like a secret drawing only you can create).

## Quantum Operations & Components

*   **Quantum Gate**: Magic moves to flip, twist, or swap qubits (e.g., X-gate = light switch flip; Hadamard (H) gate = 50/50 superposition spin; swap/dance moves for linked qubits).
*   **Quantum Circuits**: A playground path of quantum gates (slides/swings/tunnels) that steer qubits toward an answer.
*   **Quantum Interference**: Qubit "waves" that add up (constructive) or cancel out (destructive) to prioritize correct results (like pond waves or lantern light spread).
*   **Quantum Error Correction**: Fixing qubit mistakes with helper coins/backup systems (like extra stickers on toys or rescue friends).
*   **Bloch Sphere**: A magical globe showing a qubit’s superposition state (classical bits only at top/bottom; qubits can point anywhere—twirlable to see all superpowers).
*   **Braket Notation**: A secret scientist handshake for describing qubit states (e.g., |cat⟩, ⟨dog|) like toy name-tags.

## Quantum Algorithms

*   **Algorithm**: A secret recipe/set of instructions (like building a block tower).
*   **Grover’s Algorithm (Grover Search Algorithm)**: A shortcut to find a target in a large set (e.g., winning toy in a box, phone book name) in ~square root the time of classical search; uses oracles (secret tags) and diffusers (even magic energy spread).
*   **Shor’s Algorithm**: A super-fast shortcut for breaking encryption by factoring large numbers (threatens some internet secrets).
*   **Schrödinger Wave Equation**: A treasure map for qubits—shows possible positions and movement.

## Quantum Hardware & Companies

*   **Major Companies**: IBM, IonQ, Quantinuum, D-Wave, Microsoft, Rigetti, Alice & Bob, Nvidia.
*   **Hardware Techniques**:
    *   **Ion Trapping**: Trapping charged atoms (ions) as qubits (shiny marbles in a laser-poked cage).
    *   **Superconducting**: Zero-resistance circuits at cold temperatures.
    *   **Annealing**: Solving complex problems by finding the lowest energy state.
*   **Key Challenges**:
    *   **Gate Fidelity**: Making sure quantum operations (gates) are very precise.
    *   **Coherence Time**: Keeping qubits stable and “magical” long enough to do calculations.
    *   **Scalability**: Being able to build bigger and bigger quantum computers.
