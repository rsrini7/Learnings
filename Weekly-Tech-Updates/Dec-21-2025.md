#### Gemini 3 Flash — 17 Dec 2025
- Google launched **Gemini 3 Flash**, a fast, lightweight model that becomes the default in Gemini apps and APIs, offering frontier‑level reasoning with much lower latency and cost than Gemini 2.5 Flash.
- It targets real‑time use cases like chatbots and agentic coding, scoring about 78% on SWE‑bench Verified and rolling out globally in the Gemini app, Gemini CLI and enterprise products.

#### Function Gemma & T5 Gemma 2 — Dec 2025
- **Function Gemma** is a ~270M‑parameter Gemma 3 variant focused on reliable function/tool calling with structured outputs for backend orchestration in agents.
- **T5 Gemma 2** is a small encoder–decoder family that supports multimodal inputs and long context (up to around 128K tokens) while improving math, coding and multilingual performance for enterprise and research workloads.

#### Gemini CLI Conductor & Opal — Dec 2025
- **Conductor** in Gemini CLI moves specs, plans and guardrails into Markdown in your repo so the model plans before coding and better understands large, existing codebases.
- Google’s **Opal** “vibe‑coding” tool is integrated into Gemini, letting users build mini‑apps (Gems) and link workflows through natural language and a visual interface, lowering the barrier to custom AI agents.

#### ChatGPT Images & GPT‑5.2‑Codex — 10–18 Dec 2025
- **ChatGPT Images** adds faster, higher‑fidelity image generation and editing directly inside ChatGPT so teams can iterate on text and visuals in the same workspace.
- **GPT‑5.2‑Codex** is OpenAI’s most advanced agentic coding model, optimized for multi‑step software engineering and cybersecurity with strong bug‑finding and long‑horizon context‑compaction workflows.

#### ChatGPT App Marketplace — mid‑Dec 2025
- OpenAI opened a **ChatGPT app marketplace**, letting developers publish apps that plug directly into ChatGPT so users can discover and run custom tools inside the chat interface.
- This shifts ChatGPT from a single assistant into a broader app ecosystem, giving developers distribution and monetization without building separate frontends.

#### Anthropic Agent Skills & Claude in Chrome — Dec 2025
- **Agent Skills** from Anthropic are now an open standard, making it easier to share modular capabilities and reuse them across different agent platforms and workflows.
- Anthropic is piloting **Claude in Chrome** for paid users, embedding Claude directly into the browser so users can draft, summarize and analyze content without switching tabs.

#### Mistral OCR 3 — 16–18 Dec 2025
- **Mistral OCR 3** is a new OCR model tuned for forms, scans, complex tables and handwriting, claiming a 74% win rate over OCR 2 on internal enterprise‑style benchmarks.
- It preserves layout with HTML tables inside Markdown, enabling higher‑fidelity document ingestion for RAG, agents and large‑scale document processing.

#### Brave AI Browsing (Leo) — Dec 2025
- Brave introduced **AI browsing with Leo** in Brave Nightly, where an agent can research, summarize news, and assist with shopping inside an isolated profile.
- The feature emphasizes stronger privacy controls but also raises new security considerations around automated web actions.

#### xAI Grok Voice Agent API — Dec 2025
- xAI’s **Grok Voice Agent API** lets developers build low‑latency, expressive voice agents supporting 100+ languages and live web/X searches.
- It is designed for sub‑second first‑audio responses and can call custom tools while adapting to emotional cues in speech.

#### Meta SAM Audio — Dec 2025
- **SAM Audio** from Meta is a unified model for separating individual sounds (voices, instruments, noise) from mixed audio using text, visual, or time prompts.
- It targets music, film, podcast editing, accessibility and research by making advanced sound isolation faster and more accessible than traditional DAWs and plugins.

#### Firecrawl Agent Mode — Dec 2025
- **Firecrawl /agent** mode adds automatic crawling that can navigate complex, dynamic sites without predefined URLs, scripts or brittle scraping rules.
- This supports scalable lead generation, competitive research and dataset creation by turning unstructured web content into structured data for AI workflows.
