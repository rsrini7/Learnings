***

### Resolve AI (DevOps / SRE agent) – late 2025  
- **Resolve AI** is a startup (reported roughly unicorn‑scale) building agents that monitor and triage production alerts, propose or execute remediations, and automate on‑call runbooks to cut SRE fatigue.
- Its positioning is “AI on‑call teammate”: the agent plugs into incident tooling (PagerDuty‑style, logs, metrics) and handles many low‑severity, repetitive issues before humans need to intervene.

***

### “PDFs as AI goldmine” (Andrew Ng) – late 2025  
- Andrew Ng and others frame large corpora of **PDFs and documents** as the biggest near‑term enterprise AI opportunity: extract structured data, link it to existing tables, then build workflows on top.
- The thesis stresses owning the data layer and using agentic extraction systems, rather than chasing yet another generic chatbot interface.

***

### ChatGPT as app‑platform – late 2025  
- ChatGPT is increasingly framed as a **“conversational OS”**, hosting apps, agents, and integrations instead of just single chats.

- If successful, this could erode US leverage that currently hinges on controlling access to state‑of‑the‑art EUV tools.

***

### Moonshot predictions for 2026 – Dec 2025  
- Commentators predict that by 2026 AI will feel **“physical”** through robots and cars, AI‑native orgs will replace legacy “digital transformation,” remote Turing‑test‑style interactions will be normal, and many knowledge roles will shrink 10–20× in needed headcount.
- They argue systems should treat humans as exception‑handlers in AI pipelines, not the main throughput, and that education will tilt from credentials to portfolio‑style proof of work.

***

### Moonshots – “Surviving” for enterprises – Dec 2025  
- Enterprises are urged to become **AI‑driven by 2026**, starting with 2–3 high‑value use cases where they have clean data and clear KPIs.
- The view is that thousands of narrow agents, plus bespoke internal benchmarks, will drive transformation faster than a single “one big model” strategy.

***

### Google T5Gemma 2 – Dec 2025  
- **T5Gemma 2** is an open multimodal encoder–decoder family (≈370M / 1.7B / 7B) derived from Gemma‑3, built for deep understanding of long text+image documents (legal, specs, search) rather than chatty dialogue.
- With context lengths around 128k tokens and strong document‑QA benchmarks, it often beats same‑size decoder‑only Gemma‑3 variants on long‑form reasoning tasks.

***
