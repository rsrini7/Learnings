# Mathematics for Machine Learning

This document outlines essential mathematical concepts and resources for Machine Learning.

## Core ML Math Concepts

*   **Linear Algebra (Matrices):** Learn about matrix properties, multiplying matrices, LU decomposition, and determinants. This is needed for data analysis, processing, and techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) [08:54].
*   **Probability and Statistics:** Learn about random variables, probability distributions, expectation value, variance, covariance, correlation, and Bayes' Rule. This is essential for understanding your data and model results.
*   **Numerical Computation:** Learn about Gradient Descent, which is used to find a local minimum. The speaker suggests writing code for gradient descent.
*   **Calculus Basics:** Learn the Chain Rule, which is at the heart of backpropagation.
*   **Theory of Machine Learning:** Learn key terminologies and concepts like regression, train/test/validation sets, labels/targets, weights, generalization error, regularization, hyperparameter tuning (using cross-validation), and bias-variance tradeoff.
