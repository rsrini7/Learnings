I need you to analyze this codebase as an expert software architect. Please provide:

### Project Overview
- Core purpose and value proposition of this application
- Problem domain it addresses and target users/stakeholders
- Business context and where it fits in a larger ecosystem

### Technical Architecture
- Key architectural patterns and design principles employed
- System components and their interactions (with emphasis on interfaces)
- Data flow diagram or processing pipeline explanation
- Technology stack breakdown (languages, frameworks, databases, APIs)
- Dependency analysis highlighting critical external systems

### Code Organization
- Directory structure rationale and module boundaries
- Separation of concerns implementation
- How configuration and environment handling works
- Testing approach and coverage strategy

### Notable Features
- Unique or sophisticated implementations
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security considerations and implementations
- Scalability approaches

### Assessment
- Strong design choices worth preserving
- Areas that might benefit from refactoring
- Missing components or potential gaps
- Technical debt indicators

Focus on giving me a mental model of the system that would help a new developer understand both the "what" and "why" of the codebase architecture. Include any non-obvious design decisions that might reflect domain-specific requirements.
