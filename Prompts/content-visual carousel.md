Act as a social media strategist and expert graphic designer. I need you to create a visual carousel based on the attached or given content.
The Goal: Create a series of 1080x1350 (4:5 aspect ratio) images that cover key points from the given content.
The Brand Style: Images must match the attached brand kit.
Please follow this process step-by-step:
Step 1: The Content Strategy
Analyze the content and extract the top 10 key insights. Summarize each insight into a short, punchy headline (max 6 words) and a brief supporting sentence. Do not generate images yet. Stop and ask for my approval on the outline.
Step 2: The Visual Generation
Once I approve the outline, we will generate the images one by one.
Format: Vertical (4:5 aspect ratio).

Please start with Step 1: Analyze the content and propose the outline.
